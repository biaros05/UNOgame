## UNO
This project is an UNO Card game recreation!

## Description
In this project, i recreated the UNO card game with a few modifications. The essential basics are the same, however here are a few rules you may find to be different:
1. Unlike the original UNO, if DRAW 2 or DRAW 4 cards are stacked on top of one another, the total amount of cards a player must draw does not accumulate with the stack. Thus, if a DRAW 2 is placed, the next player must DRAW 2. If they decide to place another DRAW 2 on top, the next player must ONLY draw 2, NOT 4, cards.

2. In addition, if a wild card or wild draw 4 is placed, the player who played this card may be asked to choose a color multiple times if no other player has a card of that same color (you may choose the same color even if other players dont have it! You will just be asked to re-enter it.)
3. Lastly, this version of UNO randomizes the first player!

Additional Notes:
- if the first card that is faced upward is a Wild Draw 4 or Draw 2, the first player does NOT have to draw any cards.
- this game automatically checks if the player can play a card. if you enter your password and your turn is skipped, this means none of your cards were playable and a card has been drawn for you. The same rules apply for a Skip card; the program will automatically skip your turn.


## Visuals
A lot of work and compiler-error fixing was put into making the ASCII art for this project look nice. Please appreciate it! Win to unlock a very nice picture of what i like to call dancing queen spongebob.

## Authors and acknowledgment
I would like to thank my Java teacher, Swetha, for helping me with so many aspects of the game, especially the special UNO cards! All websites used to find ASCII art have been linked in code comments!
